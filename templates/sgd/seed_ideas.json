    "Experiment": "Develop an alternative to k-fold cross-validation named e-fold cross-validation. Instead of a static k it uses an intelligently chosen or dynamically adjusted paramter e to optimize the number of folds and to minimize computational energy while maintaining reliable model performance estimates.",
